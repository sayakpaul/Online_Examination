This is a simple PHP implementation of Online Examinaition system including admin control (Insert Question, Delete Question etc). The tests are based upon MCQs purely. I have also included  .csv and .xlsx files which contain questions, options and correct answers. Using it one can easily import data into RDBMS. 
I used PHP 5. Apart from that jQuery is used for validation work. MySQL is used as RDBMS.

P.S.: There are some issues in the Question dataset i.e I have included the correct answers for the Networking questions only. I hope
it will not be that much problematic.
