This is a simple PHP implementation of Online Examinaition system includinh admin control (Insert Question, Delete Question etc). The tests
are based upon MCQs purely. I have also included  .csv and .xlsx files which contain qyuestions, options and correct answers. Using it one 
can easily import data into RDBMS. 

I used PHP 5. Apart from that jQuery is used for validation work. MySQL is used as RDBMS. I will included the remaining time module (it
will show up while one gives the test) very soon.
